Hello guys, this is the README, aiming to explain a bit where to find what in this git.

In the folder [Code](Code), there are currently the code files: 
- [energy_project_task3](Code/energy_project_task3): this is Olivia's wonderful code for task 3, which create the line pareto optimal model outputs when either constraining on GWP or total cost
- [visualization](Code/visualization): this is the code which creates the visualizations of the code (or at least a first one, as simple bar chart, until now)
In the folder [excel_files](excel_files) you can find all the excels that were created to run the different models.
